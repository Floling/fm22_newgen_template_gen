# This is a simple template generator for Newgens in FM 2022

It's largely a practice project for me to get more familiar with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
This project was born out of the desire to have newgens that aren't just randomly assembled but would already have a tendency to fit into some playing roles in FM

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript

## Demo
A work in progress version can be found here
https://floling.github.io/fm22_newgen_template_gen/

## Next Steps

* Finishing the templates.

* Storing data for the role templates in the JavaScript file seems rather ineffectient and will make the code base quite bloated and not very well maintainable. As soon as I have some knowlege about how to setup a database and connect it to my site I want to move the data over there.

* Another project I want to start is calculating the average attribute strength of the players based on the templates I use for generating the attributes for newgens
** I want this part of the project to be able to take in and read a document coming straight out of FM, either the saved text file or a saved html file from the game.

# This is a simple template generator for Newgens in FM 2022

It's largely a practice project for me to get more familiar with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
This project was born out of the desire to have newgens that aren't just randomly assembled but would already have a tendency to fit into some playing roles in FM

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript
